# Group2-IMDB-Text-Classification-Analysis
A comparative study of text classification architectures (Traditional ML, RNN, LSTM, and GRU) using multiple embedding techniques (TF-IDF, Skip-gram, and CBOW) on the IMDB 50k Movie Review dataset. This project evaluates how diff vectorization strategies impact the performance of sequence models and traditional classifiers in sentiment analysis.
